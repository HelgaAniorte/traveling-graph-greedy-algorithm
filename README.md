================================

Starting out from city K, you have to plan a series of daily trips. Each day you want to visit a previously unvisited city in such a way that, on a route to that city, you will also pass through a maximal number of other unvisited cities (which will then be considered to have been visited). We say that the destination city is our daily travel target.
